<h1>Selecting Geometry</h1>
<p>
	Many commands in ${module.name} require design geometry to be selected before
	starting the command. There are several ways that geometry can be selected and
	ways that the current selection can be modified so that you can easily select
	the design geometry to want to modify.
</p>

<h2>Selecting a Single Geometry Object</h2>
<p>
	Single geometry objects (lines, arcs, paths, etc.) can be selected by simply
	clicking on the object. When an object is selected, it's color will change to
	the selection color indicating that it is selected. Single geometry objects
	can be added or removed by holding the Ctrl key while clicking as noted	below.
</p>

<h2>Selecting Geometry with a Window</h2>
<p>
	Multiple geometry objects (lines, arcs, paths, etc.) can be selected using a
	window. Window selection has two modes, containing and intersecting. When
	using containing mode, the geometry must be entirely contained by the window
	to be selected. When using intersecting mode the geometry contained by or
	intersecting the window is selected. By default, window selection uses
	containing mode. Use the Ctrl key to use intersecting mode.
</p>

<h2>Modifying the Current Selection</h2>
<p>
	The current selection can be modified by adding and removing individual
	geometry object by holding the Ctrl key while click on the object.
