<h1>Relative Coordinates</h1>

<p>
	There are several ways to enter relative coordinates. This can be a simpler
	way to specify points rather than entering absolute coordinates. Relative
	coordinates always require that a prior point be available as the reference
	point. This is usually accomplished by entering the first point in a command.
</p>
<h2>Orthographic Coordinates</h2>
<p>
	Relative coordinates are always specified by using the '@' symbol.
</p>
<h2>Polar Coordinates</h2>
<p>
	For polar coordinates, angles are denoted by the '<' symbol. The angle
	coordinate may be entered before or after the radius coordinate. A further
	simplification is that the angle symbol may be used in place of the comma
	between the coordinates.
</p>
<p>
	Polar Coordinate Example: @4,<30<br/>
	Simplified Angle Example: @2<-15<br/>
	Angle First Example: @<270,4
