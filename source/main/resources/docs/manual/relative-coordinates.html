<h1>Relative Coordinates</h1>
<p>
	There are several ways to enter relative coordinates. This can be a simpler
	way to specify points rather than entering absolute coordinates. Relative
	coordinates always require that a prior point be available as the reference
	point. This is usually accomplished by entering the first point in a command.
	Relative coordinates are always specified by using the '@' symbol.
</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<table>
	<tr><td>Orthographic Coordinates:</td><td>@4,5</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Polar Coordinates:</td><td>@4,&lt;30</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Simplified Angle:</td><td>@2&lt;15</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Angle First:</td><td>@&lt;270,4</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Orthographic Coordinates</h2>
<p>
	For orthographic coordinates, coordinates are specified as normal with the
	x and y coordinates separated by a comma.
</p>

<h2>Polar Coordinates</h2>
<p>
	For polar coordinates, angles are denoted by the '<' symbol and entered in
	degrees. The angle coordinate may be entered before or after the radius
	coordinate. A further simplification is that the angle symbol may be used in
	place of the comma between the coordinates.
