<h1>${action.name}</h1>
<h2>${action.command}</h2>
<p>Change the scale of design geometry.</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Select objects to scale</li>
	<li>Type ${action.command}</li>
	<li>Select an anchor point</li>
	<li>Select a reference point</li>
	<li>Move the reference point to choose a new scale</li>
	<li>Select the target point</li>
	<li>The objects are modified to the new scale</li>
</ol>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>
	This command changes the scale of selected design geometry. The command
	requires that geometry be selected before starting the command. Please refer
	to <a href="xenon:help:/com.avereon.carta/docs/manual/selecting-geometry">selecting geometry</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
	Once you have selected the design geometry you want to scale, start the
	command by typing ${action.command}.
</p>
<p>
	You are then prompted to enter an anchor point. The anchor point will stay
	stationary while the geometry is scaled around it. For example, if you want to
	scale a rectangle and keep the lower left anchored where it is, select the
	lower left point on the rectangle as the anchor.
</p>
<p>
	You are then prompted to enter a reference point. The reference point is used
	to determine both the new scale value and direction of the scale will be
	applied. Moving the reference point toward the anchor will make the geometry
	smaller and moving the reference point away from the anchor will make the
	geometry larger. It is even possible to mirror the geometry by moving the
	reference point past the anchor point.
</p>
<p>
	Once the reference point is selected then the design geometry is resized
	according to the new scale.
